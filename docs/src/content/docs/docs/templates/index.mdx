Fiberplane Templates are programmable workflows that allow you to automate notebook creation for your incident response, infrastructure debugging, and maintenance.

## Overview of a template

Templates are defined by a Jsonnet file that is added to your Fiberplane account through the CLI.

Templates export a Jsonnet function that accepts some parameters and creates a Notebook using the helper functions provided by the Fiberplane Jsonnet library (fiberplane.libsonnet). See an example template below:

```jsonnet
local fp = import "fiberplane.libsonnet";
local c = fp.cell;

function(
  incidentName="Service Outage"
)
  fp.notebook
  .new("Incident Response for: " + incidentName)
  .setTimeRangeRelative(minutes=60)
  .addCells([
    c.text("Hello World!"),
  ])
```

Let’s break it down line by line:

```jsonnet
// Import a helper Jsonnet library for working with Fiberplane notebooks.

local fp = import "fiberplane.libsonnet";
local c = fp.cell;

// Call a Jsonnet function passing a string ‘API Outage’ as a parameter incidentName.

function(incidentName="API Outage")

  // Initiate a Fiberplane notebook.

  fp.notebook

  // Calls a method that adds a title for the notebook passing a hardcoded string
  // and the parameter concatenated.

  .new("Incident Response for: " + incidentName)

  # Sets the time range for the notebook to be relative to last hour

  .setTimeRangeRelative(minutes=60)
```

## Setting up Templates

:::note
To work with templates you will need to have the Fiberplane CLI installed. See: [CLI](/docs/cli).
:::

The easiest way to get started with the template is create the structure you want in the Notebook and then in the top right corner click "Share > Download as Template”

This will download the existing notebook with the content saved as a Jsonnet file. Alternatively you can use the `fp templates init` CLI command to generate an empty template in your current directory

You can then edit the template using a text editor of your choice. Save the template as a Jsonnet file once you’re happy with it!

## Adding templates to your Fiberplane account

You will need to add your template to your workspace to start using it in Fiberplane. To add the template run the following command in your terminal (See [CLI](cli), to get started with the Fiberplane CLI):

```bash
fp templates create /path/to/template.jsonnet
```

The `fp templates create` command will then ask you to provide the title and description of your template, and will add the template to your Fiberplane account.

You can verify that the template is added by listing out all of your templates with `fp templates list` or by navigating to your Fiberplane home screen’s *Templates* tab.

## Updating templates

If you have made changes to your Template that you want to upload to Fiberplane you can run the following command:

```bash
fp templates update --template-path /path/to/template.jsonnet
```

The command will fetch a list of current templates and ask you which template you want to update and overwrite.

## Removing templates

If you have a template you would like to remove from your gallery, run the following command passing the ID of your template as an argument:

```bash
fp templates remove 
```

These are the basic functions to get you started with Templates in Fiberplane.  To see the full reference of available CLI commands see [CLI reference](/docs/reference/templates).
