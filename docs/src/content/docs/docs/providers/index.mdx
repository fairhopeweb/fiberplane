Providers are full-stack plugins in Fiberplane that allow you to pull in live data directly from your infrastructure data sources into your Notebooks. They are compiled to WebAssembly and can run both on the Studio and the `fpd`.

Your data sources can be added from the Studio using direct access (if your data sources URL are open) or using the `data_sources.yaml` file that is then passed in the Docker or Kubernetes configuration. Hereâ€™s an example configuration file for connecting to a single Prometheus instance:

```yaml
# data_sources.yaml

- name: prometheus-prod
  description: Prometheus (Production)
  providerType: prometheus
  config:
      url: http://prometheus:9090
```
