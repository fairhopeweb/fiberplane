# base64uuid

> `Base64Uuid` type for representing base64url-encoded UUIDs.

The main motivation for using these is that their representation is slightly
more compact compared to standard UUID string representation, and they look a
bit better in URLs.

In addition, any UUIDs generated by this crate are chosen such that their string
representations do not start with a dash (`-`), in order to avoid conflicts if
they're used as command-line arguments.

## Feature flags

- `creation`: Allows creating `Base64Uuid` and `Uuid` directly (enabled by default)
- `fp-bindgen`: Allows using `Base64Uuid` within
  [`fp-bindgen`](https://github.com/fiberplane/fp-bindgen) structs
