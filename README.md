# `fiberplane-rs`

This repository is a monorepo for Rust code that is used throughout Fiberplane's
product.

## Overview

- [base64uuid](base64uuid/) - A utility for working with base64url-encoded
  UUIDs. We use them throughout Fiberplane products, though the crate is usable
  on its own.
- [fiberplane](fiberplane/) - A convenient umbrella crate that re-exports all
  the `fiberplane-*` crates.
- [fiberplane-api-client](fiberplane-api-client/) - API client to interact with
  the Fiberplane REST API. Is generated from the OpenAPI schema located in
  `schemas/openapi_v1.yaml` and uses the models from `fiberplane-models`, so the
  client is based on the same models we use internally.
- [fiberplane-markdown](fiberplane-markdown/) - Utilities to convert Fiberplane
  Notebooks to and from Markdown.
- [fiberplane-models](fiberplane-models/) - Our core data models, ranging from
  notebook and cell definitions, to types used in the provider protocol as well
  as those for our real-time operations.
- [fiberplane-provider-protocol](fiberplane-provider-protocol/) - The definition
  for our low-level provider protocol and the bindings that are generated from
  it.
- [fiberplane-templates](fiberplane-templates/) - Our Jsonnet template engine.
